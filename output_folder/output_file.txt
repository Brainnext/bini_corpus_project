is not usually one’s enemy; this
was explained by the fact that
he is ‘‘of the same blood’’, and
that he shares one’s properties.)

analysed. If e.g. the image of a
sick man falls into the “‘canoe”’,
somebody will die. The image
of a goat e.g. resting in the
“canoe” points to the sacrifice
of a goat required for some pur-
pose, e.g. for curing an illness.

oval shape, made of a pounded

with water or, when making a
‘stronger’? exwae, with coco-
nut milk or blood. Those
‘stronger’’ exwaes must not be
made in one’s house (in the
egii [_]) but in the bush. The
exwae is usually kept in the ega,
i.c. the apartment where one’s
Ost [| | stands; in that case it is
used to “push” one’s enemies
into danger (v. sua [ /]), and
also in cursing and blessing. In
other cases it stands under a
small thatched shelter outside
the wall of the compound; those
exwaes are of a ‘“‘stronger’”’
nature: they are called exwae
n-odiota ['.. | “main exwae’’,

man ’’, and they give strength to
the particular god whom the
owner of the exwae follows.
Others are found in the shrines

blood of sacrifices (v. wa [ /];
owaise [| |). Possibly the
exwaes always have some rela-
tion to the Osi [|]; they are
also said to be “‘moving with
witches”, and, therefore, the
witch-doctor holds an exwae
when “giving chop to witch-
craft’ in order that it may com-
municate with the witches and
tell them that they are given
food. A curse is: exwaa (exwae

Uhé[._]; heis said to have been
the first Bini man to grow oil
palms, and therefore he is the
“owner’’ of all the oil palms of
the country though this pro-


bably does not mean practical
Ownership; he used to bring a
human sacrifice to the palm
tree once a year, the sacrifice
being performed at one palm
tree at Uhé which is supposed to
stand on the spot where the first

are even said to have seized men
from Benin City; he is the head

uhuki [" /_] an influence or power
(spirit?) which causes people to
do things that are to their dis-
advantage, and seem to be
senseless. Uhuki is said to be
caused by ill-treatment of, or
lack of consideration for, one’s
wife or husband in the preceding
reincarnation. The actual cause
seems to be the “swearing”’

200


uttered during one’s previous re-
incarnation by the injured party
against the offender. Offences
leading to this swearing and
consequent uhuki are e.g. a
man’s not giving his wife food
and clothes, or not having inter-
course with her on the day when
she purifies herself after men-
struation, ora wife’s promiscuous
way of living (so that the
husband forsakes her), or her
omitting to mourn for her de-
ceased husband properly (v. xié
(| /]); uhuki okpokp-ee [' 7]
“uhuki (it is that) is troubling
him (or her)’’. The “trouble”’
caused by uhuki may manifest
itself in very different ways, and
in different degrees of intensity.
A man may refuse to marry and
may hate women, or even be
temporarily impotent or mad;
with a woman it is believed to
be the cause of frigidity and cer-
tain misdemeanours. A sacrifice
can “bring them (1.e. the uhukis)
to sense’: a “doctor”? makes
an image representing the hus-
band or wife, respectively, of
the preceding reincarnation, and
makes a sacrifice to it. After-
wards, the image is_ buried
with the sacrifice (ofe_uhuki
[.. 7.] he buried the uhuki).
The uhuki was said not to be
the dead man (or woman)
himself.

following noun of locality, as

216


e.g. In v-uwu [°'] “in inside”

top of; v-oto [° ] “in ground”:
underneath. In this ‘way, the
English prepositions are ex-
pressed by means of one Bini
preposition only, linked with
various local nouns. v-obo [| ]
lit. “in hand’’, means “from”’
when a human being is qualified
by it. v- is also employed to
form a great number of ad-
verbial expressions, as €.g. v-eva

locality still further away than
that indicated by v-eva); v-eta
[. \] here; v-ofe [°°] outside;

verbially, e.g. v-od-ago [ \.] in
front (generalised by adding ode
“road’’), in front of; v-iyeke

ehia (xié [']) [°°] “I sold
twenty pounds in all”: I sold
goods amounting to the value
of twenty pounds. v-erio ["/]

muegbedco ["*- /] a bird, rather

big, similar to idu [°_] (a dove);
cries at night, and in the
evening and morning. Its cry,
believed to be caused by worm-
bite, is interpreted as “(I am)
ready for Benin’’, i.e. a cry to
affirm its willingness to go and
serve the dba, while, on the
other hand, the worms that in
Bini belief cause it to cry are


thought to be a punishment for
a previous refusal to serve the
dba. Another interpretation is
a mockery directed at boys
whose mouth is affected by
yaws: (u)nu ofiofio [ " / | (cf.
ofi{ “}). The bird is also called
osaikpe [ 7/1].

(e)n- 1 relative particle (not in-
dispensable) ; the following pro-
noun which is closely linked up
_ with it has low tone in the ipf.
and high tone in the pf., e.g.
n-opu_ee [. \] who does; n-
opu_ce [| \]| who did; in the
plural, i can be used with the
relative particle, e.g. ekita n-ibii
[ °.. ] many dogs (dogs that are
numerous).

n- 2a particle conveying, to-
gether with a particular con-
struction (auxiliary ya[ |; tense-
particle -a [']), the idea ex-
pressed by the English ‘‘instead
of doing...’; n-u-ayaru_ee,
ukele fua[ ° “\. \._/] instead of
doing it youran away. Possibly
the particle is identical with
(e)n- 1, and the sentence a re-
lative clause.

(e)n- 3 particle introducing a sub-
junctive (with a high or mid-
tone pronoun); ow-en-itu_ee
L. °° y] (we [/]) he told me to

three other different forms em-
bodying the objective pronouns

527

e.g. In orhi-ece me [ \'] he
gave it me; irhi-epe nwue [ \ 7]
I gaveit you;irhi-epene[ =f]
I am giving it him; (2) also ex-
presses that something is done
for somebody: ortu_ee ne [ " fy]

nwina na yivo [ “\ /]
where is the man for whom we
are working?; cf. me [‘], ne [\],

nwue | /].

be-y-iho n-ihd [* ~~ * 7: | don’t
tell it me for I don’t want to
hear (it). n-erhudu[’ ] to bless
(somebody: na ["]) ; occasionally
the blessing is accompanied by
the speaker taking his exwae [* ]
and blowing over it in the
direction of the man whom he
blesses (curses are emphasised
by touching one’s lips with
the lips and then _ spitting);
on-erhudu ne [| \] he blessed
him. n-inye ['] to gossip;

[ .. ‘'y] don’t defame somebody
else’s son!

na 3 [ | in n-ema [' ] to tie the

yam branches to the yam poles
(ikpesi [_] and eye [.']) by
means of ropes or creepers
(ika& ["_] e.g.) in order to spread

farm yesterday to (go and) tie
the yam branches up; cf. inema
L...]; uv. halema [° ], vi-ab-
ema [ J.

na 4[ ] an auxiliary verb used in

relative clauses when the rela-
tion is a temporal, causal, or


local one: ‘‘“when’’; ‘“‘where”’;
‘‘therefore’‘; v-eye  n-inare
[\°] at the time when I
came; v. ya 2 [ |.

na [ ] (1) attributive demonstra-
tive pronoun: “this’’; preceded
by a high tone, e.g. sda na[_ 7 |
this man. (2) at the end of a
sentence it means something like
‘now’, but perhaps it implies a
notion of locality as well; ukp3_
uxigé na [|] are you selling
cloth now, Le. aS you are
standing here; with nia [ /] in-
stead of na, it would mean: are
you selling now or not? e.g.
when the man addressed is
fidgetting with the cloth; c/. ona
[. jjv. ni L/)).

n-aka [".] (1) middle(?); only in
ed-eké n-aka [ | the day inter-
mediate between two rest-days,
ic. the second day after each
rest-day (ek& [, ]); perhaps it
means, however, originally “the
minor eké.’’ (2) mild; innocuous;
in ame n-aka [ "| mild rain,
and, perhaps, in enye n-aka
[ °.] grass-snake; cf. (e)ne | \].

(e)nafé [\ ] idiom. for n-onya-fé

(e)n-at-usi ["*] all the time; ke-n-
ad-usi yade [°'*-_/] “from all
the time coming’’: since all the

_ time; cf. (e)ne [\], usi [, J.

(e)ne ["] or [\] a demonstrative
element apparently to some
extent equivalent to the English
definite article; it is always put
in front of the noun qualified by
it, but if the noun is followed by
the name of a locality, the ne
stands before this, e.g. Jdxwahe

1 Wo)

n-ixué [| / \.] ‘the dxwahe of
Ixué’’. It occurs also in a
reduplicated form: nene [|
which probably is more em-
phatic, e.g. n-oda [°)] “the man
(spoken of)’’, nen-oda[’*y] “that
very man”’. If a noun is re-
peated with the ne placed be-
tween the two repetitions, the
meaning of the noun is aug-
mented by the notion “big”, or
“real, main, principal’, eg.
imaze y-ota n-oda-te, amaw-
uwe [47 .] (we LA) Ido
not mind a big (i.e. important)
man, how much less you;
inwina n-inwina_inwina ne na
L.. oY... A~.4] something like

“this is a good job of work I
did for him’’. When preceding
nouns expressing time like ede
["] “day”, eye [..] “time”,
ukpo [. ] “‘year’’, it conveys
the idea of ‘“‘ago’’, e.g. n-ede
[\ ] or ['*] “in the old time’,
“in the old days’, as in
i he ede ot- “uwa na_ iherh-tikpd
[oe FP ie the old times
your age-group did not yet wear
cloth” (to a young boy); fur-
ther: n-ukpo [\ ] “last year”’
(cf. ukpo na [ ] or n-ukpo na
“this year’’), with the forms
n-ekp-ia |) /] “two years ago”,
lit. ‘‘three years ago’’, as the
current year is included in
the calculation, n-ekp-ene ['*- |
‘three (lit. four) years ago’,
n-ekp-isé [°°-] ‘‘four (lit. five)
years ago’, etc.; v. n-ev- [ ],
eye [ J, ede [."], node [,}.
Finally, ne is often used in front
of the ordinal numbers, e.g. in
n-okao [.] “‘the first’, n-ogieva
["..] ‘‘the second”’, etc. which
can also (without the exception


of “the first’’) occur preceded
by ukp-, as e.g. in n-ukp-ogieha
[°..] “the third’’.

n-ema ["_ ]; cf. na 3 ["].

n-erhutu ("| J]; cf. na 2 ["].

ne 1['} to defecate; ene [ *\] he

followed by vo [_/] “where is”’:
cf. also le[ ]; if€[..] is also used,
but only of human beings, while
ne is used of things mostly; ne
vo [ 7] where is it?

ne [\]; cf naz ['].

n-ev- [|] an element preceding the
word ede [.°] “day’’ combined
with a numeral, or one of the
nouns meaning a certain number
of days; it adds the idea of
“ago”’, cf. (e)ne [ \]; e.g. n-ev-
usé [ *] “‘five days ago”’ (in-
cluding to-day, i.e. according to
European calculation four days
ago); n-ev-edeha ["'/] six
(five) days ago; n-ev-ede-hifs
[ .] seven (six) days ago;
n-ev-ede_cudagé [|] eight
(seven) days ago; n-ev-uhuduréi

amount of fees to be paid by
members of a society; n-ani me

ifa n-iyo me ze ["- ] they de-
cided on a (certain amount of)
money for me to pay.

ni| /] (preceded by a high tone)
demonstrative pronoun: ‘‘that”’.
It occurs also in the form fi,

also used after a relative sen-
tence, e.g. 9ba n-ore ni ose de no

Further, it is used after other
verbal forms: uxia ni [': /]
something like: “‘are you going
over there?’ or, “ youover there,
are you going?” cf. ani (of) [1];
v.na[ ].

nia (also fia, which is rejected by

the method of divination (v. also

seeds of the above-mentioned
tree are used. The instrument of
divination consists of four strings
each of which contains four

137

halves of the seed. At one e!
of each string a small bell (ero
[“""]) and some cowries a

fastened. The diviner (ab-ogwe

[.y.]) seizes one end of ea
string and throws them with t
intention of turning them upsi
down. The subsequent arrang
ment of seeds is then analys
(v.eria[ ”]) according to a certé
code (itie [.°]), the criteri
being the “‘open”’ or “‘coveres
position of the seed-halves. T
analysis is said to proceed at fi
from the right side to the le
and, after that, in the oppos
direction, but as if the arran;
ment were looked at from t
other end of the strings. I
different positions have nam
e.g. odi [.] is a string with t
two outer seed-halves show!
their inside, and the two in1
halves showing their cov
(Under the headings deal
with these positions, 0. V

positions are: odi [_], oyoi [,
opuhu [."], oyae [."], ogbi [
ako ['], ose [.], oha [
erhoxwa [ |, eka[. ], oka [.
ova [..], eture [.'"], ete [.
ogha [| and eyité [°]. As 1
relations of two strings to ¢
another are always consider
these names are usually co
bined, e.g. oh-oyae [J] (<
+oyae). If both positions ;
the same, their name is follow
by n-abe [\] “combined”, ¢
oka n-abe [.\.]. The “‘code”
this divination gives a fb
sentence for each of these co
binations, and the task of °


diviner is to explain to his client
the meaning of the sentences
appropriate to the arrangements
of seeds. As these represent
certain typical situations in life,
their corresponding names in
the code are often used as
idiomatic (““deep’’) expressions
for these typical situations, »v.
eh-oyae[ |andokan-abe[ /\ ].
The actual throwing of ogwega

Osa [..] (2) the Bini high god,
creator of the world; his worship
seems to have developed mostly
since the times of the Oba Esigie
[":.]; he has shrines and priests
in Benin City only; the cult
was stated to be a later out-
come of the early Portuguese
missionary activity developed
after the departure of the Euro-
pean missionaries. The cross
plays a role in the cult: the
Osa [..] shrine at Akpakpava
[ \.] street contains a cross
and a kind of rosary, the state
sword of the dba (ada [*"]) that
is used when he goes to ar-
osa | \.], the Osa shrine, was
said to bear a cross, and the
badges worn by participants in
the new yam fast (agwe [_])

the oh-3sa | \_], the Osa priest,
are in the shape of a cross. The
three shrines in Benin City were
said to stand on the sites of
early Portuguese chapels. Osa
is often called Osanobua [. ‘y],
Erhatosa [ _\.], “godfather”,
and has also the names Oyodua
[°. \], Ododua [7 7 \](?), Udazi .
["/,], and Itebite [~\], which
have been taken over by Chris-
tian translators. Many names

world”’; viz. me; Osayide [f°]

obo 1r[ | (pl.e-) a ‘doctor’; there
are oracle-, witch- and ordeal-
doctors as well as those who
cure, or make rain. The oracle-
doctors are composed of four
different groups according to
the different kinds of oracles;
there are ob-ogwega [| ).], ob-
ewawa [.\..], ob-akepele [-\..],

157

and ob-ofdmila [ ° |. The ab-
ewawa may be an 9bo n-oz-ise
[....] ‘“‘a doctor who chooses
seeds’’, i.e. one who gives the
name of a suspect to each one
of several seeds (when trying to
find out the perpetrator of an
offence), and finds the guilty
one by means of ewawa [__ |.
The ordeal-doctors, ob-ita [ \.]
are ob-it-dfigbd [ °'.| “palm-
oil-ordeal-doctor’’, ob-it-ébe
[°*-] “leaf-ordeal doctor”, or
abo n-od-ita [|] (one who
knows all sorts of ordeals). The
experts for the feather- and
sasswood-ordeals have no special
name besides that of ob-ita.
The witch-doctor, obo n-owa
n-azé[ 7. | “‘ doctor who gives
food to the witches’’, also called
abo n-oy-ada [| “doctor who.
goes to the cross-roads”’, leads
negotiations with witches and
pacifies them by gifts of food
from his clients. The “curing
doctor’’, ob-odi [ |, bears no
outward sign of his profession,
but is usually very competent
and cures people for money or
for their services. A doctor who
makes his diagnosis by looking
into his patients’ eyes (in case
of illness or ‘‘juju-trouble’’) is
called sbo n-omi-ato [|] Le.
‘‘a doctor who looks eye”’.
An antisocial individual working
with ‘“‘bad medicines’ may be
called ob-erhia [ ° ] a “‘spoil-
doctor”’. A “‘ doctor’ who travels
round the country and makes
a living by it is called obo
n-oy-eria [.... ] ““a doctor who
goes grazing”. The four types
of oracle doctors are represented
by different people. The ob-


ogwega [| \ | practises only that
sort of oracle. Other doctors
may know the method, but they
are not called ob-ogwega. If
another doctor does not know
the ogwega, he may have to call
in an 9b-ogwega. The ob-ogwega
is paid for his work, but he is
also a farmer, as the money he
earns is not a sufficient liveli-
hood. The oracle 1s learned from
another ogwega doctor (without
staying with him); itie [ '] (the
code) is said to take at least
three months to learn. After
this, eria [ |, the analysis of the
code-words, is learnt. That is
said to take more than six
months. If a man is too keen
on learning eria so that he starts
on it before knowing itie pro-
perly, he is supposed never to
learn itie correctly. Then he is
called: ota n-ogu-eria xe_iha
[ ~“: ] *“‘a man who knows
analysis waits for the oracle,
i.e. the calling out’’. An ewawa
learner must be a servant under
a doctor. The ewawa doctor, who
is always an Osii [ ‘| priest, also
undertakes cures, but they are
not as good as the ob-odi. Most
of them also give food to witches.
Their servant is called ohagba
[...] or owaise [J]. The ap-
prenticeship takes four to seven
years because the pupils learn
cures at the same time. Ewawa
doctors are payed with money
and they only farm when they
have a big family. They make
many charms, e.g. some for
traders ensuring good business,
some warding off danger for
travellers, some against witches
for sick people, etc. Especially

if 38

a charm “mentioning a man’s
name’ (eb-usueni[ \__] “‘name-
mentioning charm”). and a
charm speaking by itself (ovi_efi2
di [. °.] “son of the Under-
world’’) procure them more
clients than the other oracle
doctors have. This fact, together
with their acting as witch
doctors, enables them to make
a living by being doctors only,
without additional farm work.
Their knowledge of herbs is,
however, said to be smaller than
that of the eb- “ofsmila [ *_ |.
An ob-akpele [ >) _] is mostly an
Olokii { '°] priest, i.e. not a
priest at a public shrine, but he
has a bigger Oloki shrine in his
house than an ordinary Oloki
shrine. Many of his clients come
to his Oloki shrine and bring
things for the yearly Oloki
sacrifice (eh-oloki [ °*:]}). The
oracle method is learnt in about
six months’ time. During this
time the pupil keeps his akpele
[...] in a pot at his Olokié
shrine (which nearly every adult
possesses). Charms are also put
into the pot, and the akpele
has first been charmed by the
teacher, a full communal Oloké
priest. Afterwards the akpele
is put on an ukpabo [__] tray
and taken to some cross-roads
(ada [ |) where it is charmed
again and buried with the charm
for a fortnight “in order to see
the truth”. (Ada being a meet-
ing place for witches, spirits,
etc., anything hidden chere sees
theni.) Akpele and Ogwega have
to be familiar with witches be-
cause they procure food for the
witches by indicating pacifica-


tion sacrifices, ese [,.]. After
the fortnight, the pupil, having
learnt his craft, takes 1t out and
is an db-akpele. The 9b-ofSmila
must be a ‘priest’ of JfSmila
[...], ie. Ifa (Yoruba). (But
there are no public shrines or
priests of Of3mila.) IfS5mila is
the Yoruba god of palm kernels
(and divination), and people
from Akure e.g. are more expert
in this method than Bini people.
A full babalawo [,. ] (Yoruba
name for the dfSmila priest)
gathers the kernels from the
base of ivi_3f3mila [°° J, “OF.
kernels”, a special sort of oil
palm, and gives them to the
pupil. The pupil and his family
smoothe the kernels by means
of a grindstone, wash them with
a charm and keep them for three
months in a pot of oil. This is
called ovi-ofSmila [..°.,] ‘‘he
has taken the df5mila” (pl.
verb). During this time small
sacrifices are made to them until
the pupil is (financially) able to
“take” them. If he has nomeans
he must possibly leave them in
the pot for a year. At last, big
sacrifices are made over a period
of a fortnight during which
time the pupil must procure an
axwexwe [°°], i.e. oracle in-
strument, of his own. Then the
dfsmila are taken out and are
afterwards put on an ukpo [|
(mud bed) on which many cloths
have been spread, forming a
heap with a shallow cavity at
the top. Parrot-tail-feathers are,
among other things, added as
adornments. The babalawo asks
the kernels whether the pupil
will live long and be prosperous

(i.e. have many children). Only
after this installation of the
Jf5mila kernels is the teaching
started which takes more than
a year, and at the end of which
the pupil becomes an ob-
ofsmila. Some of these doctors
are farmers, some traders. They
also concern themselves with
cures, and they also learn about
medicines. The oracle plays a
part in their cures by naming
the leaves to be used in special
cases (by quoting previous in-
stances). The money given to
the ob-of5mila does not enable
him to live on his practice as is
the case with ob-ewawa. Ordeal
doctors are not priests.

edi3 n-ene[ \. ], the fourelders,
also called ikadel-ene [' ], the
four pillars, are the four men
who are in control of the internal
affairs of a village. These do not

The odid-wete gives his orders
after consultation with his col-
leagues and may impose fines in
cases of disobedience, consisting
of the seizure of a chicken or a
goat. His power has been much
weakened with the young gene-

share of the percentage of tax
refunded to the village, of killed
animals, and of any royalty that
may be paid to the village, e.g.
